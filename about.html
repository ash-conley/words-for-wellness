        <p>
          The Words for Wellness Project is a project created for college students, by college students. Our main focus is on college students—those of you juggling school, work, social life, and the pressures that come with all of that. But honestly? No matter where you’re at, this is a space for anyone who wants to use writing as a way to improve mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mental health crisis among young adults is a serious and complex issue, with statistics showing alarming increases in feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Recent studies by the NIHM (National Institute of Mental Health) report that nearly half of college students in the U.S. have felt persistent sadness or hopelessness in the last year, and factors like academic pressures, financial stress, and the lingering impacts of the pandemic have only worsened the situation. Among young people, suicide has become the second leading cause of death, signaling a need for proactive mental health support and community resources.
        </p>
         <p>
          Certain groups, such as LGBTQ+ youth, face additional challenges due to experiences of discrimination and a lack of inclusive resources, which further heighten their mental health struggles. Social media also plays a double-edged role; while it can connect, it often contributes to increased anxiety and social comparison. Recognizing these struggles, Words for Wellness was created to offer young adults a supportive space where creative writing is used as an accessible, reflective outlet for mental health. By fostering self-expression and community through writing, we hope to empower students to process their emotions, reduce stress, and gain resilience—one story at a time.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Ash. I created the Words for Wellness project because I know firsthand how transformative writing can be. As a student, I’ve gone through my share of stress, self-doubt, and overwhelming emotions, and writing became my go-to outlet. It wasn’t about writing the perfect story or creating something to share with others—it was about letting my thoughts spill out in a way that helped me process everything. Through writing, I’ve found clarity, comfort, and a way to express feelings I didn’t even realize I had bottled up. Now, I want to share that same sense of relief and creativity with others. Writing has always been my form of self-care, and I’m passionate about helping others discover that for themselves.

        <p>
          As a queer and neurodivergent creator, I know how hard it is to find spaces that feel safe, validating, and creative all at once. Words for Wellness is a piece of my heart and a gift I hope can support yours.
