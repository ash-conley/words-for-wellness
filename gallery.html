              I wrote letters to the trees I left behind. Not with envelopes or stamps, but in the quiet corners of my notebook. Every town we passed felt like a question I wasn’t ready to answer. 
              <br><br>
              My mom said, “We’re starting fresh.” But starting fresh feels more like forgetting. And I don’t want to forget who I was before the move. 
              <br><br>
              On the third night in the new house, I sat by the window, journal in my lap. “I still hear the wind the same way,” I wrote. “Maybe that means I didn’t leave everything behind.”

              Elsie wrote there when recess felt too loud, when the world forgot how to be kind. She filled the pages with kingdoms, dreams, and daring girls who climbed trees and rescued dragons. <br>
              No one else believed it was real. But when she grew up and became a teacher, she kept a journal on her desk—just in case someone else found the shelf.

              Grief made everything louder. The silence after my brother died wasn't silent, it screamed. I couldn’t speak it, so I wrote it. I wrote letters I never sent, lists of memories, fragments of dreams that still smelled like hospital rooms.
              <br><br>
              Some days, all I wrote was, “I miss you.” But on the days I couldn’t write at all, I flipped through old pages and remembered: healing isn’t linear, but the page is always waiting.

            <p class="card-text">
               I sat on a park bench with no phone, no music, no plans. Just wind and birds and the sound of my own thoughts.<br>
               It felt unfamiliar, like meeting someone I used to know but hadn’t seen in years.<br><br>
               I realized how loud everything had become—notifications, expectations, noise pretending to be need.<br>
               That hour didn’t solve my life. But it reminded me I still had one.<br>
               I went home and wrote for the first time in weeks.<br>
